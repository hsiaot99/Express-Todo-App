# Express-Todo-App
This project is an Express.js application that connects to MongoDB, handles todo list operations via RESTful routes, and uses EJS for templating.

Structure
•	app.js: Entry point of the application where Express is configured and routes are defined.
•	index.js: Initializes the Express application and starts the server on the specified port.
•	init/mongodb.js: Contains logic to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose or native MongoDB driver.
•	routes/todo.js: Example route file where todo-related routes are defined.
•	public/: Directory for static assets like CSS, images, etc.
•	views/: Directory for view templates (if using a view engine like EJS).
Dependencies
•	Express: Web framework for Node.js
•	Body-parser: Middleware to handle HTTP POST request bodies
•	dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env
•	Mongoose (optional): MongoDB object modeling tool (if using Mongoose for MongoDB interactions)
